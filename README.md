# Hands-On Analytics Engineering Project

This repository contains my completed project from the **LinkedIn Learning** course *Hands-On Analytics Engineering Project*.  
It demonstrates an **end-to-end data engineering workflow** from extraction to visualization, built and tested in **GitHub Codespaces**.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to:
1. **Extract** data from an external source.
2. **Load** the data into a relational database.
3. **Transform** it into a clean, analysis-ready format.
4. **Visualize** it to deliver insights for stakeholders.

This mirrors real-world analytics engineering tasks, where raw data is prepared for decision-making in an organization.
